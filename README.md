# Food Delivery Web App

A full-stack and fully functional Food Delivery web-app built using the **MERN stack**.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express to handle server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **Payments**: Integrated with Stripe for payment processing.

## Cautions

1. Ensure all the dependencies are installed before running the project. The backend uses the default server as the database, but if you wish to rename it, simply go to `backend/config/db.js` and update the name.
   
2. The `.env` file is required with the following information:
   - **Database connection string**
   - **Stripe secret key** for payment handling

3. To run the project, ensure both the frontend and backend are set up and running:
   - **Backend**: Go to the `backend` folder and run `npm install` and `npm start`.
   - **Frontend**: Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` and `npm start`.
